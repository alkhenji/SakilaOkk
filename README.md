SakilaOkk
==========

This repository contains a Django project to render the MySQL Database Sakila in a Web Application.

## Prerequisites:
This application requires Django 1.6.5, if you don't have it you can get it by:

```
    # Installing pip (Python Package Index)
    $ sudo easy_install pip

    # Installing Django 1.6.5
    $ sudo pip install django==1.6.5

    # Installing MySQL for Python
    $ sudo pip install MySQL-python
```

## Installation & Running the Application

```
    $ cd /path/to/save/app
    $ git clone https://github.com/alkhenji/SakilaOkk.git
    $ cd SakilaOkk
    $ python manage.py runserver
```

## How to run:
The application requires Django 1.6.5. If you have PIP, you can install it by running:
$ sudo pip install django==1.6.5

## Running the application locally:
You will need to be connected to the CMUQ-SECURE network to be able to access the database. If you are using it from outside CMUQ, you will need to use a VPN to gain access to the database.

To run the application, open terminal and go to the application file:
```
    $ cd ~/path/to/sakilaokk
    $ python manage.py runserver
```

... and that's it :)!
